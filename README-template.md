# 1. Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game

100 Projects Till I Get Hired: Project 1 - Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

This is the first project in my personal series, 100 Projects Till I Get Hired, where I challenge myself to build 100 unique projects. The goal is to grow my skills, learn new technologies, and demonstrate my journey as a mid-level developer. This series is not just about coding—it’s about collaboration, sharing knowledge, and inspiring others.

In this project, I tackled the Rock, Paper, Scissors challenge from Frontend Mentor, enhancing the classic game with real-time multiplayer functionality using React, Node.js, and Socket.io.

Through this series, I aim to improve, inspire collaboration via pull requests, and pass on what I learn to friends who are just starting their journey into the amazing world of software development. I’m not an expert, but by working on these projects, I hope to continue growing my expertise and ultimately land my dream job in tech.

Stay tuned as I document my progress, learn, and share insights from each project along the way.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Experience a responsive game layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the Computer or a Friend through real-time socket connections.
- Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**
